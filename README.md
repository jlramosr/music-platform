# Music Platform

This app is made with ReactJS and a minimum part of Redux. It was bootstrapped with *create-react-app*.

With `npm run start-front`, we just run the frontend on the port 3003.

To persist data, I use *json-server*. With `npm run start-back`, we just run the backend, setting up on the port 3004.

## How to run the whole project

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Usage

Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3003` and enjoy.

## Demo
